            <strong>Pokémon (Japanese: ポケモン, Hepburn: Pokémon), abbreviated from the Japanese title of Pocket Monsters 
                 and currently branded in English as Pokémon the Series (テレビアニメ「ポケットモンスター」シリーズ, Terebi Anime
                  'Poketto Monsutā' Shirīzu, TV Anime "Pocket Monsters" Series), is a Japanese anime television series, part of
                   The Pokémon Company's Pokémon media franchise, which began broadcast in Japan on TV Tokyo in April 1997.

                The anime franchise consists of seven sequential series in Japan, each based on a main installment of the Pokémon
                 video game series. In the international broadcasts, these series are split across 24 television seasons, with the 
                 24th season, Master Journeys, streaming on Netflix in the United States (with additional episodes to be released 
                 quarterly).[2] Each of the series follows Ash Ketchum, a young trainer of fictional creatures called Pokémon. 
                 Joined by his partner Pokémon Pikachu and a rotating cast of human characters, currently Goh, Ash goes on a journey 
                 to become a "Pokémon Master", travelling through the various regions of the Pokémon world and competing in various
                  Pokémon-battling tournaments known as the Pokémon League.

                Ash Ketchum, known as Satoshi (サトシ) in Japan, is a fictional
                character in the Pokémon franchise owned by Nintendo. He is the
                protagonist of the Pokémon anime and certain manga series as well as
                on various merchandise related to the franchise. Ash Ketchum was first
                mentioned in a video game at the dialogue of Pokémon Play It!, and his
                first appearance in a game was in Pokémon Puzzle League. Satoshi
                Tajiri, the creator of Pokémon, with whom Ash shares his Japanese
                name, has stated that Ash represents the 'human aspect' of the series,
                and that Ash reflects what he himself was like as a kid.
