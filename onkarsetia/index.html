            <strong>The original Pokémon is a role-playing game based around building a small team of monsters to battle other monsters in a quest to become the best. Pokémon are divided into types, such as water and fire, each with different strengths. Battles between them can be likened to the simple hand game rock-paper-scissors. For example, to gain an advantage over a Pokémon that cannot beat an opponent’s Charizard character because of a weakness to fire, a player might substitute a water-based Pokémon. With experience, Pokémon grow stronger, gaining new abilities. By defeating Gym Leaders and obtaining Gym Badges, trainers garner acclaim.

              Pikachu, a yellow mouselike creature, is the undisputed face of Pokémon and helped the series become a worldwide phenomenon. Pokémon inspired a cartoon series, movies, books, a toy line, sequels, spin-offs, a clothing line, and a popular trading-card game. In spite of a friendly interface and little violence, Pokémon has not been without controversy, however. In 1999 the parents of two nine-year-old boys sued Nintendo, stating that the Pokémon card game had caused the children to develop gambling problems and likening the trading-card craze to an illegal lottery. Religious groups that discount the theory of evolution also targeted Pokémon, for showing Pokémon evolving into new creatures.

                Ash Ketchum, known as Satoshi (サトシ) in Japan, is a fictional
                character in the Pokémon franchise owned by Nintendo. He is the
                protagonist of the Pokémon anime and certain manga series as well as
                on various merchandise related to the franchise. Ash Ketchum was first
                mentioned in a video game at the dialogue of Pokémon Play It!, and his
                first appearance in a game was in Pokémon Puzzle League. Satoshi
                Tajiri, the creator of Pokémon, with whom Ash shares his Japanese
                name, has stated that Ash represents the 'human aspect' of the series,
                and that Ash reflects what he himself was like as a kid.

            <h3><em>Pikachu</em></h3>
            <p>
              Pikachu is widely considered to be the most popular and well-known Pokémon species,
               largely due to its appearance in the Pokémon anime television series as the companion
                of protagonist Ash Ketchum. In most vocalized appearances Pikachu is voiced by Ikue Ōtani,
                 though it has been portrayed by other actors, notably Ryan Reynolds in the live-action animated 
                 film Pokémon Detective Pikachu. Pikachu has been well received by critics, with particular
                  praise given for its cuteness, and has come to be regarded as an icon of Japanese pop culture.

            <h3><em>Bulbasaur</em></h3>
            <p>
              Bulbasaur is a Grass/Poison-type Pokémon species in Nintendo and Game Freak's Pokémon franchise. 
              It is the first in the franchise's monster index, called a Pokédex. Designed by Atsuko Nishida, Bulbasaur 
              debuted in Pocket Monsters: Red and Green (Pokémon Red and Blue outside Japan) as a starter Pokémon. Since then, 
              it has reappeared in subsequent sequels, spin-off games, related merchandise, and animated and printed adaptations of the franchise.

              Known as the Seed Pokémon, Bulbasaur can survive for days solely on sunlight. 
              It likes to take a nap in the sunshine. While it sleeps, the seed on its back 
              catches the rays and uses the energy to grow. It is a central character in the Pokémon anime, 
              being one of Ash Ketchum's main Pokémon for the first season, and a different one later being obtained 
              by May. It is featured in various manga, and is owned by protagonist Red in the Pokémon Adventures manga. 
              Bulbasaur has been featured in myriad pieces of merchandise, including toys, key chains, and plush dolls.
